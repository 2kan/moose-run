How to use
--

Moose Run was built with slick in the eclipse IDE. Link the sick.jar and lwjgl.jar and you're good to go. I would advise changing the package name to suit your own use.

It's a fairly simple game I created in 48 hours and has a lot to be improved on, but it's here for anyone to use for whatever purpose.
